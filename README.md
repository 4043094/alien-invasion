# Alien Invasion 
Alien Invasion is a game where you have a ship that shoots bullets, and a fleet of aliens. As the game progresses, the fleet gets closer.
When a bullet hits an alien, the alien and the bullet both disapper. The aliens are worth points, which are awarded once you kill the alien.
If an alien touches you or the bottom of the screen, you lose a ship and the screen restarts. You have three ships to begin with. Once all three
ships are used up, the game ends. Once you destroy a fleet, a new one pops up and you level up. When you level up, the game speeds up. Have fun playing!
